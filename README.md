P&amp;E Homework 1
In class, we talked about how a CPU runs through instructions linearly performing calculations. Think about whether you have ever performed a task like this in your life. What was it?

The biggest task I could think of was developing film. With developing film, you have a list of steps to get the best exposure for your film and if you mess up one of the steps or mix up one of the chemicals then the entire roll is messed up. For example, when developing film you have to start with a pre-wash then move on to the developer. After the developer, I have to basically stop the developing process with the stop bath chemical and so on. If a chemical is changed then the photos I took will not come out.
